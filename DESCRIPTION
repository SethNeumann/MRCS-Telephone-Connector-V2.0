This board provides connectors to extend the MRCS power and phone bus (used by the EBF31A Battery 
Feed and ATSN Dispatcher/Operator Boards) to as many as 12 stations. Thsi version has a single bucking 
converter which provides 12V for buzzers, lamps etc.  Removed aux power for Morse Code Buzzer Controller
(MCBC) as a revised (V1.0) MCBC will have an onboard (pre) regulator to take 24V down to 9V which
***should*** be adequate for ProMini clones.
