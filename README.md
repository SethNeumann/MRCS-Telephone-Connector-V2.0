This board provides connectors to extend the MRCS power and phone bus (used by the EBF31A Battery Feed and ATSN Dispatcher/Operator Boards) to as many as 12 stations. Pads are provided for a bucking converter to develop 12VDC for buzzers, LEDs and Relay Latches. I’ve been developing a series of circuit boards to perform the various functions needed to build a layout phone system, but I never made a central board to distribute the phone line and auxiliary power. In the past I assumed the user would use either telephone style “66 blocks” or barrier strips to distribute these signals, but that has become a road block for some users, so this board, with its on board screw terminals puts the basic connections in one place. Features:

• Takes power from the 6-conductor modular telephone and +24V power bus (note to phone people: this is positive 24 to keep things simple for non-phone model railroaders) • Two 6 conductor Jacks are provided for daisy chaining the bus. Connectors are oriented with the locking tab up for easy connection and disconnection.

• Connector pads provide up to 12 connections on 0.100 centers for Tip, Ring, +12 and Ground. If you are assembling your own board and need less connections, you can use screw terminals (or your favorite 0.100 connector) with fewer positions

• Optional auxiliary 6 position screw terminal brings all lines on the bus out for easy access

• Polarity protection diode protects against use of non-reversing (DCC Bus 6 conductor cable)

- 2.1 mm barrel jack for 24vdc input

• Pads for an LM2596 bucking converter which provides 12V for buzzers, LEDs and Relay Latches etc., or you can substitute a boost converter for any voltage up to 35VDC

All components are through-hole technology for ease of assembly and repair.
